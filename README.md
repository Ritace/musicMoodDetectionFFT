musicMoodDetectionFFT uses generated FFT as training data to machine learning algorithms to detect the input music files

This algorithm uses sample files which I didnot upload but can be downloaded from 

Just follow the steps:
1.Download the traning data from
http://opihi.cs.uvic.ca/sound/genres.tar.gz

2.Just place the downloaded folder in the same folder as the folder where code is placed

3.Change the files to .wav format

You are good to go
